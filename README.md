## Vogon: scalable customization of video campaigns

Vogon combines a video creative, a data table and a layout specification,
generating a copy of the video creative combined with each line of the data
table according to the layout specification.

The data can contain text and images. The specification determines the timing,
position and font definitions for each piece of text and image, referencing
data fields through their names. Fixed text can also be used in the layout
specification.

The generated videos are (optionally) uploaded to a Youtube channel, and a 
campaign specification file is generated to be imported in AdWords for Video,
creating geo-targeted campaigns for each of the videos.

This is not an official Google product.
